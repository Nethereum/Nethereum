changes\n\nModel:\n *New Transaction7702\n* New Transaction7702Encoder (RLP encoding / decoding)\n* TransactionFactory update to create 7702 transactions directly, from a generic input or rlp\n* New transaction Type (0x04)\n* Authorisation7702 and Authorisation7702Signed both supported by Encoders, First one used to sign authorisations\nRPC:\n* New Authorisation RPC object and Model mappers\n* Changes to TransactionInput and Transaction to include Authorisations\n* Changes to TransactionManagerBase to include identification of EIP7022 transaction types if included the authorisation list, also include common methods to Add authorisations or remove authorisations to the next request, default gas calculation optimised to add extra 2500 per authorisation if either present on the transaction input or in the next requests to be appended to the transaction\n\nSigner:\nNew: Transaction7702Signer similar generic same as 1059\nAuthorisation7702Signer signer to authorise items requests before including them into the 7022 transaction.\nEthECKeyBuilderFromSignedAuthorisation to recover the the signer from Authorisation7702Signed  authorisation\n\nUpdates:\n* EthECKeyBuilderFromSignedTransaction update to recover from Transaction7702  transaction\n* EthExternalSignerBase generic external signer support of 7702.\n* Aws, Azure enable generic signing of 7702\n* Ledger, Trezor, marked as unsupported\n\nAccounts:\n* AccountSignerTransactionManager  at the time of nonce allocation, does the signing of all the authorisations to ensure correct nonces in sequencing order based on the nonce manager, authorisations are merged from the request queue onto the transaction input.\n* OfflineTransactionSigner update.\n* ExternalAccount signing partial support whilst it can sign the 7702 this needs to be implemented to SignAuthorisationAsync and nonce flow\n\nContracts\n* Added AuthorisationList to the common contract object and encoding services\n\nTests\n* Signing Integration tests, included smart contracts examples BatchCall as a contract to be used as 7702 (enabling multiple calls) and
